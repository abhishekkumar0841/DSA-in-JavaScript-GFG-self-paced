- What is DSA?
    - DSA stands for Data Structures And Algorithm.
    - Data Structures means the way to organize data in main memory or RAM.
    - Algorithm means the sequences of steps to solve a problem.

- Why DSA is important
    - Learning DSA is important because it makes us a better programmer or software developer.
    - This teach us how to store the data in memory so that the machines (CPU) process the data faster, and give us output quickly.
    - It help us to getting a job, because many companies take first round of DSA to filtered out the candidates. Many company also ask is in multiple round also.
    - It also helps us to winning the sport of the competitive programming.
